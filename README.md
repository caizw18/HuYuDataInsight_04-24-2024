# HuYuDataInsight_04-24-2024
This is the workload for our company HuYuDataInsight LLC on Apr 24, 2024

We split the dataset into two parts, one is the training part and another is the validation part. We use training dataset to train models in machine learning. 
Learning from the training dataset, the models will minimize its prediction error on the training samples by adjusting its parameters.We use validation dataset 
to evaluate the performance of models after training. According to models’ performance on validation dataset, we can know the models’ ability on generalizing 
to unknown data.

We test our code in “code/main.py” and visualize the training data from class 1 and 2 by implementing the function visualize features. The visualization doesn’t
include the third feature. Therefore, it’s a 2-D scatter plot.

We test our code in “code/main.py” and visualize the results after training by using the function visualize results.

We implement the testing process and get the test accuracy of our best logistic regression model.
